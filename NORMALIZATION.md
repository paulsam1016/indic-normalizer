## Background & external validation

This section grounds the design in the ASR-normalization literature and confirms our
approach against the standard Indic tools. The governing principle throughout: **a
normalization is legitimate only if it maps two surface forms a human would call "the same
words" onto one form, and never merges forms that differ in meaning.** Because we normalize
**both reference and hypothesis identically**, our bar differs from a training normalizer's
— we need a form that is **stable** and **meaning-preserving**, not the "linguistically
correct" one.

### The Whisper "vanishing vowels" pitfall — why we do NOT strip by Unicode category

The default multilingual normalizer (OpenAI Whisper's `BasicTextNormalizer`, also in
Meta MMS, Seamless, AssemblyAI Conformer, and HuggingFace `transformers`) is **actively
broken for Indic scripts**, and it silently *lowers* reported WER — worse than being noisy.
For non-English text it does NFKC, then **replaces every character in Unicode category
`M`/`S`/`P` with a space**. In Brahmic scripts the **vowel signs (mātras) and the virama
are Mark (`M`) characters**, so this strips the vowels, not punctuation:
`ഇതൊരു ഉദാഹരണമാണ്` → `ഇത ര ഉദ ഹരണമ ണ` (a meaningless consonant skeleton).

Measured impact (Manohar et al., ACL 2024, on FLEURS): splitting words at every vowel sign
inflates the reference word count, so **Malayalam WER fell 152 points (287%→135%)** on the
baseline model purely from the normalizer; METEOR similarity between a Malayalam sentence
and its own normalized form is **0.00**. English/Finnish survive only because their
diacritics compose under NFKC into single Letter-class codepoints; Indic vowel signs have
no composed Letter form, so NFKC can't save them.

**Implication for our code:** never apply a Mark-class or "strip all combining marks"
filter to Indic text. Our `universal.py` correctly removes an *explicit punctuation set*
(E5), not a Unicode category — this is the single most important thing we get right, and it
must stay that way. A future "clean up marks" change would silently reintroduce this bug;
guard against it with a self-normalization identity test (see [C7](#c7)).

### Why chillu / `ൻ്റ` mismatches exist (and NFC won't fix them)

Malayalam chillu letters have an atomic codepoint (Unicode 5.1+) but the same glyph is also
writable as `consonant + virama + ZWJ` (legacy) or `consonant + virama` (bare). Unicode
deliberately gave the atomic and ZWJ forms **no formal canonical decomposition** (to avoid
destabilizing existing data), so **NFC/NFNC leave them distinct** — a reference in atomic
chillu and a hypothesis in the ZWJ sequence mismatch on every chillu. Handled by E2.

The `ൻ്റ`-vs-`ന്റ` conjunct (E12) is subtler and **no external tool handles it**: IMEs emit
atomic chillu-n + virama + `റ` for the very common *nṯa* conjunct instead of the correct
`ന` + virama + `റ`. NFC doesn't unify them, and the reference libraries' chillu rules don't
either (they compose *toward* atomic chillu or decompose *word-final* chillu; this is a
chillu wrongly sitting *before* a virama). E12 is our own fix and our biggest single win.

### How our approach maps to the literature

- **Manohar, Pillai, Sherly — "What is Lost in Normalization?" (ACL 2024)** proves the
  vanishing-vowels harm and mandates **linguistically-informed, language-specific
  normalizers** (it deliberately proposes no algorithm). Our per-language module in
  `scripts/normalizers/malayalam.py` is exactly that approach.
- **SN-WER (ACL 2026 MeLLM)** proposes a script-insensitive companion metric for
  cross-script / romanized settings. Not needed for single-script Malayalam scoring, but
  the relevant direction if we ever score against romanized references — report it
  *alongside* WER/CER, not instead.
- **Unicode primary sources** (L2/05-308; PR-66; Thottingal's Malayalam Unicode report) are
  the authority on why chillu/ZWJ mismatches exist and why NFC won't fix them.

Verdict against the standard tools (full table in the
[appendix](#appendix-external-tool-comparison)): **our normalizer is the strongest of the
set for ASR scoring.** It does three things no off-the-shelf tool does — the `ൻ്റ→ന്റ` fix
(E12), digit verbalization (E8), and English↔Malayalam number canonicalization (E9) — and
it avoids both known traps (Mark-class stripping, and opinionated typo/spelling
"correction" — see the note under [Recommended order](#recommended-order)).

## How normalization affects the two metrics

How normalization affects the two metrics:

- **WER** is driven by anything that changes **how the string splits into words** — the
  word-count / boundary problem. One boundary disagreement flips two tokens at once (a
  substitution *plus* a deletion or insertion), so segmentation variants inflate WER even
  when every character is correct. This is the "word-segmentation variant" effect that
  dominated the Malayalam v0/v2 gap.
- **CER** is driven by residual **character-level** mismatches that survive normalization
  (spelling drift, encoding variants, final-vowel forms). Boundaries matter far less to CER,
  so CER is the fairer view for agglutinative Malayalam.

Rule of thumb for prioritization: fix the WER-side (segmentation) items to stop *overstating*
error; fix the CER-side items to reduce *genuine* residual error. Adopting a spacing-insensitive
CER as the headline Malayalam metric neutralizes most WER-side segmentation noise at once.

## Already handled

Applied in `scripts/normalizers/malayalam.py` (`normalize()` order: indic-nlp/chillu fix →
NFC → `<unk>`/`⁇` → zero-width → Indic-digit→ASCII → group-comma → punctuation →
English-number canonicalization → digit verbalization → lowercase → whitespace collapse).

The **Complexity** column rates what each rule took to *build* (same ★ scale as the gap
tables — **★ trivial** library call/one substitution … **★★★★ hard** bespoke logic with
guards). Rows keep pipeline order, not difficulty order, because the sequence is load-bearing
(e.g. E6→E7→E8 must run before verbalization, E12 must run first).

| # | Item | Effect | Complexity | Notes |
|---|------|--------|:----------:|-------|
| E1 | Unicode NFC | CER | ★ trivial | Canonical composition — stdlib `unicodedata.normalize`. |
| E2 | Chillu / ZWJ-ZWNJ canonicalization | CER | ★ trivial | One call into indic-nlp-library (a required dependency); the library does the work. |
| E3 | `⁇` / `<unk>` removal | CER + WER | ★ trivial | OOV marker; fixed-string removal from both sides. |
| E4 | Zero-width (ZWNJ/ZWJ/BOM) drop | CER | ★ trivial | Fixed codepoint set stripped, after the chillu fix. |
| E5 | ASCII + Indic punctuation removal | CER + WER | ★ trivial | One character-class regex; includes danda `।` `॥`, quotes, dashes. |
| E6 | Indic-digit → ASCII (`൦-൯`→`0-9`) | CER | ★ trivial | Fixed 10-codepoint translation table. Feeds verbalization. |
| E7 | Digit-grouping commas (`70,000`→`70000`) | CER + WER | ★★ easy | Regex, but must fire before `,`→space so both surface forms meet — ordering-sensitive. |
| E8 | Native digit verbalization (`24`→`ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`) | WER + CER | ★★★★ hard | Bespoke number-to-Malayalam-words logic: 1–4 digit runs read as a number, longer/zero-padded read digit-by-digit, with the sandhi glide `യ` inserted at joins. |
| E9 | English-style number words → canonical Malayalam (`ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ`→`ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`) | WER + CER | ★★★★ hard | Convention-invariant scoring: a spelling-tolerant word parser, with ambiguous `ടു`/`ഫോർ` converted only beside an unambiguous number word, and lakh units mapped. |
| E10 | Lowercasing | CER | ★ trivial | `str.lower()`, for code-mixed Latin tokens. |
| E11 | Whitespace collapse + trim | WER | ★ trivial | One regex: multiple spaces → one. |
| E12 | Mis-encoded chillu conjunct (`ൻ്റ`→`ന്റ`; also `ൺ ർ ൽ ൾ ൿ` before virama) | CER | ★★★ moderate | Small closed map, but built on a real insight and guarded: a chillu + virama is not a real chillu — it's the base consonant typed with the wrong codepoint (`വിവേകാനന്ദൻ്റെ` vs `വിവേകാനന്ദന്റെ`), NFC-invisible. Rewritten to the base-consonant form; genuine word-final chillu (no following virama) left untouched. First step in `malayalam.normalize()` (`_fix_chillu_conjuncts`). |

## Mode selector — `eval` vs `inference`

`normalize()` takes a **`mode`** argument. There are **two behaviours**, four accepted names:
`mode="eval"` (**default**) with `"training"` and `"fine-tune"` as aliases, and
`mode="inference"`. The two express opposite *contracts*:

- **`eval` (model-facing)** — used for WER/CER scoring **and** for building training / fine-tune
  targets. Aggressive canonicalization: strip everything that isn't signal, and render every
  number as **native Malayalam words** (`24` → `ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`). Most ASR tokenizers have no
  `0–9` pieces, so a digit in a target becomes `<unk>` and teaches the model to emit `⁇`;
  verbalizing avoids that. This is the current behaviour, unchanged.
- **`inference` (reader-facing)** — used on the model's **output**, shown to a human. It does
  **ITN** (inverse text normalization): every number → **digits** (`ഇരുപത്തിനാല്` → `24`,
  `ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ` → `24`), and it **preserves** punctuation and letter case so the transcript
  reads naturally (`50,000 രൂപ`, not `50000 രൂപ`).

A shared **canonicalization base** runs identically in both modes (encoding fixes, NFC,
zero-width drop, Indic→ASCII digits, whitespace) — the two contracts only differ on the four
split steps and on number *direction*.

| Step | `eval` / `training` / `fine-tune` (model-facing) | `inference` (reader-facing) | Split? |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|:------:|
| E12 chillu-conjunct fix (`ൻ്റ`→`ന്റ`) | applied | applied | — shared |
| E2 chillu / ZWJ canonicalization | applied | applied | — shared |
| E1 Unicode NFC | applied | applied | — shared |
| E4 zero-width drop (ZWNJ/ZWJ/BOM) | applied | applied | — shared |
| E6 Indic-digit → ASCII (`൨൪`→`24`) | applied | applied | — shared |
| E3 `<unk>` / `⁇` removal | stripped | stripped | — shared¹ |
| E11 whitespace collapse + trim | applied | applied | — shared |
| **E5 punctuation removal** (incl. group-comma) | **strip all** | **keep** (punctuation is part of a readable transcript, and lives inside numbers: `50,000`, `4.5`, `10:30`) | **✅** |
| **E10 lowercasing** | **lowercase** (case-insensitive scoring) | **preserve case** | **✅** |
| **E8 digit verbalization** | **digits → native words** (`24`→`ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`) | **native words → digits** (ITN: `ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`→`24`) | **✅** |
| **E9 English-number canonicalization** | **→ native words** (`ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ`→`ഇരുപത്തിനാല്`) | **→ digits** (`ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ`→`24`; front-half value parse kept, back-half emits `str(value)`) | **✅** |
| C6 homoglyph (`ഠ`→`0` in a number) | applied | applied | — shared (unambiguous) |
| C2 word-final `മ്`→`ം` | applied | applied | — shared (unambiguous) |
| **C1 samvruthokaram fold** (`നാലു`→`നാല്`) | **applied** (symmetric scoring fold) | **off** — would strip a real `-u` from a reader transcript | **✅** |
| W1–W5, C9–C16 (future gap rules) | apply (scoring canonicalization) | **off** — collapsing register / segmentation variants would *degrade* a human transcript | **✅ by nature** |

¹ `<unk>`/`⁇` is **stripped in both modes** for now (it was not in the requested split set). If a
future need arises to surface model uncertainty to the reader, inference could instead map it to
a neutral marker (e.g. `[?]`) — noted as an open option, not implemented.

**Design note.** It is not eleven independent toggles — it is **two contracts** sitting on one
shared canonicalization base. `eval`/`training`/`fine-tune` are the *same* behaviour (aliases);
only `inference` flips the four split steps and reverses number direction. Number *canon* still
runs in inference (English-style number words resolve to a value first), so all conventions —
`24`, `ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ`, `ഇരുപത്തിനാല്` — converge on clean digits on output.

## Missing — primarily affects **WER** (segmentation / boundary)

Highest leverage, because this is where the observed gap lives.

**Fix difficulty** (how mechanically tractable): **★ trivial** = one fixed regex/substitution,
no lexicon, no ambiguity · **★★ easy** = a small closed-set regex or table, few guard cases ·
**★★★ moderate** = curated whitelist/map + guards against real minimal pairs · **★★★★ hard**
= needs a sizeable lexicon or morphological analysis, real risk of collapsing distinctions.
Rows are ordered easiest-first within each table.

| # | Item | Why it hurts WER | Fix difficulty | Status / suggested fix |
|---|------|------------------|:--------------:|---------------|
| W4 | **Intra-word hyphen handling** (`covid-19` → `covid 19`) | Removing hyphen *to a space* splits one token into two; `covid-19`/`covid19`/`covid 19` land in three word counts. | **★ trivial** | **Implemented (opt-in, `segmentation=True`).** `_join_intra_word_hyphen`: `(?<=[^\s\d-])-(?=[^\s\d-])` → `` (letter–letter only; **digit-adjacent hyphens excluded** — see the numeral-suffix note below). |
| W3 | **Acronym / letter-sequence spacing** (`എ ടി എം` vs `എടിഎം` vs `ATM`) | Each convention is a different token count. | **★★ easy** | **Implemented (opt-in).** `_collapse_letter_runs`: collapse a run of ≥2 single-*grapheme* tokens into one (`എ ടി എം`→`എടിഎം`). Cross-script acronym map not added (no measured need). |
| W5 | **Reduplication / echo words** (`വേഗം വേഗം`) joined vs spaced | Boundary-only word-count mismatch. | **★★ easy** | **Implemented (opt-in).** `_collapse_reduplication`: collapse adjacent identical tokens to one; **number-words excluded** so id-like digit runs (`007`→`പൂജ്യം പൂജ്യം ഏഴ്`) are not eaten. |
| W2 | **English code-mixed token spacing** (`ഫോൺ നമ്പർ` vs `ഫോൺനമ്പർ`) | Inconsistent join of borrowed compounds → word-count mismatch. | **★★★ moderate** | *Gap.* Small join/split lexicon for frequent borrowed compounds — needs a curated list, no clean regex. |
| W1 | **Sandhi / compound & postposition split-merge** (`വീട്ടിലേക്ക്` vs `വീട്ടില് ലേക്ക്`) | Same phrase, different word count; the single biggest boundary contributor for agglutinative Malayalam. | **★★★★ hard** | *Gap.* Sandhi rewrites characters at the join, so splitting needs real morpheme boundaries (a wrong split corrupts genuine single words). Curated split/merge map, built + guarded carefully. |

## Missing — primarily affects **CER** (character-level residue)

Reduces genuine residual error; most-per-line-of-code wins first. **Fix difficulty** uses
the same ★–★★★★ scale as the WER table above. Rows ordered easiest-first (C7 is resolved,
listed last).

C6/C2/C1 are **implemented**, applied symmetrically to ref and hyp. **C6 and C2 run in both
modes** (unambiguous); **C1 is eval-only** (a symmetric scoring fold that can touch a genuine
`-u` vowel, so it is not applied to reader-facing inference output). There is no flag — these
run automatically. C3/C4/C5 remain gaps.

| # | Item | Why it hurts CER | Fix difficulty | Status / suggested fix |
|---|------|------------------|:--------------:|---------------|
| C6 | **Visual-lookalike letters/digits** (`ഠ` used as zero in a number) | Homoglyph substitution inside a number. | **★ trivial** | **Implemented — both modes.** `_fix_homoglyphs`: `ഠ`→`0` only when digit-adjacent (`1ഠ0`→`100`); a standalone `ഠ` or one inside a word is untouched. Fires 0× in the current corpus but harmless. Latin `O`/`0` deliberately **not** mapped (too ambiguous). |
| C2 | **Anusvara vs nasal spelling** (word-final `മ്` vs `ം`) | Per-character substitution surviving current pipeline. | **★★ easy** | **Implemented — both modes.** `_fold_final_nasal`: word-final `മ്`→`ം` (`വരാമ്`→`വരാം`; tolerates trailing punctuation in inference, `വരാമ്.`→`വരാം.`). Only the labial `മ്`; the `ന്` nasal is left alone. Unambiguous. |
| C1 | **Samvruthokaram / final-vowel drift** (`നാല്`/`നാലു`; final `ു്`/`ു` → `്`) | Hits nearly every word ending → large, broad CER contributor. | **★★ easy** | **Implemented — eval only.** `_fold_samvruthokaram`: word-final consonant+`ു്`/`ു` → consonant+`്` (`നാലു`→`നാല്`). **Symmetric scoring fold, not a spelling corrector** — it can't tell a samvruthokaram `ു` from a real `-u` vowel, so it also folds short words (`ഒരു`→`ഒര്`); fine for symmetric scoring but wrong for a reader, hence eval-only. It is the main CER win (see impact note). |
| C3 | **Conjunct / reph / `്യ`·`്വ` ordering variants** not unified by NFC | Multiple valid encodings of the same conjunct. | **★★★ moderate** | *Gap.* Mostly handled by indic-nlp already; the residual needs targeted per-conjunct rules found by audit — not a single regex. |
| C5 | **Foreign-word transliteration variants** (`ഫോൺ`/`ഫോണ്`, `ബസ്`/`ബസ്സ്`) | Same borrowed word, different spelling. | **★★★ moderate** | *Gap.* Curated canonical-spelling lexicon for frequent borrowings — inherently a hand-built list, no regex. |
| C4 | **Long-vowel / gemination spelling drift** (`ാ` vs `ാാ`, `ക്ക` vs `ക`) | Casual-transcription doubling/undoubling. | **★★★★ hard** | *Gap.* Gemination is *contrastive* in Malayalam (`കല` art vs `കല്ല` stone), so no blanket `CC→C` rule is safe — needs a conservative per-word whitelist. |
| <a name="c8"></a>C8 | **Bare (ZWJ-less) word-final chillu** — `consonant + virama` word-finally may not unify with atomic chillu. | Legacy/IME chillu without ZWJ mismatches an atomic-chillu reference. | **★ trivial** | *Not implemented (dropped by request).* Would be a 6-entry word-final map (`ന്`→`ൻ`, …), the inverse of E12. |
| <a name="c7"></a>C7 | ~~indic-nlp fallback parity gap~~ **RESOLVED** — colon→visarga and two-part vowel-sign composition used to fire only when indic-nlp-library was installed. | (was) an environment-dependent CER difference. | — (done) | **Fixed** by making `indic-nlp-library` a **hard dependency**. Single code path now; no parity gap remains. |

> **C1/C2 measured impact.** Unlike the W-family, the endings folds **help on every measured
> cell**: dataset **WER −1.09**, CER −0.14; calls WER −0.21, CER −0.06 (per-rule, C1 does most
> of it; C2 adds a little on dataset; C6 is 0×-but-safe here). They run automatically — no flag.

## Corpus-measured spoken-form variants (new — from ref↔hyp diff analysis)

These were found by diffing the reference and hypothesis of the real call + dataset
corpora (`call_ref/hyp.txt`, `dataset_ref/hyp.txt`), taking every token pair that **still
differs after normalization**, and classifying whether the two forms are the *same word*.
The pairs below are recurring, systematic same-word variants **not** covered by E1–E12 /
W1–W5 / C1–C8. Occurrence counts are over both corpora combined (≈2,000 distinct
post-normalization substitution types; ~48% were genuine ASR errors and excluded).

The dominant axis here is **spoken vs written Malayalam**: the reference is written-standard,
the hypothesis (ASR of conversational speech) captures the colloquial pronunciation. These
are a *different class* from the encoding/spelling items above — they are dialectal/register
variation, so canonicalizing them shades toward the "opinionated correction" line the
[Recommended order](#recommended-order) note warns against. Each is legitimate **only** as a
curated, conservative, symmetric rule (or a whitelist), never a blanket transform, and only
where the two forms are truly the same lexeme. Ranked by measured frequency.

Same difficulty scale as the tables above (**★ trivial** … **★★★★ hard**). These are
*register* rules, so even the regex-shaped ones carry the C4/C5 caveat below — cheap to
*write* is not the same as safe to *ship*. Rows ordered easiest-first.

| # | Item | Example (ref → hyp) | Occ. | Fix difficulty | Notes / suggested fix |
|---|------|--------------------|------|:--------------:|-----------------------|
| <a name="c14"></a>C14 | **English `-ing`: `-ംഗ്` ↔ `-ങ്`** | `ട്രെയിനിംഗ്`↔`ട്രെയിനിങ്`, `വെഡ്ഡിംഗ്`↔`വെഡ്ഡിങ്` | 48 | ★ trivial | Word-final `ംഗ്`↔`ങ്` is a single fixed substitution. A **C5 sub-case** (loanword spelling); fold into the borrowing lexicon. |
| <a name="c13"></a>C13 | **Colloquial nominalizer** `-ന്നത്` → `-ന്നേ` | `വരുന്നത്`→`വരുന്നേ`, `ചെയ്യുന്നത്`→`ചെയ്യുന്നേ` | 48 | ★★ easy | One word-final suffix regex `ന്നത്`→`ന്നേ` on a closed verbal ending; few guard cases. |
| <a name="c11"></a>C11 | **Copula / question reduction** `-ആണ്`/`-ആണോ` → `-ആ` | `എന്താണ്`→`എന്താ`, `എങ്ങനെയാണ്`→`എങ്ങനെയാ`, `ശരിയാണ്`→`ശരിയാ` | 142 | ★★ easy | Small closed-set ending rule on the `āṇ(u)` copula; canonicalize one direction. Same lexeme. |
| <a name="c15"></a>C15 | **Nasal assimilation `ൻപ`/`ൻ` ↔ `മ്പ`/`മ്`** | `ഒൻപത്`↔`ഒമ്പത്`, `മുൻപ്`↔`മുമ്പ്`, `മുൻപോട്ട്`↔`മുമ്പോട്ട്` | 45 | ★★ easy | Small closed map/regex (`ൻപ`↔`മ്പ`); both spellings current. A handful of high-frequency stems covers most of it. |
| <a name="c16"></a>C16 | **`യ്ക്ക` ↔ `ക്ക` sandhi** (dative/verb) | `ഉച്ചയ്ക്ക്`↔`ഉച്ചക്ക്`, `അടയ്ക്കാൻ`↔`അടക്കാൻ`, `അയയ്ക്കുക`↔`അയക്കുക` | 26 | ★★ easy | Regex to drop/insert glide `യ` before geminate `ക്ക`; small guard set. Related to C4. |
| <a name="c10"></a>C10 | **Final vowel-sign length `െ` ↔ `േ`** (short↔long e) | `ഓക്കെ`→`ഓക്കേ`, `പക്ഷെ`→`പക്ഷേ`, `അല്ലെ`→`അല്ലേ`, `അതേ`→`അതെ` | **645** | ★★★ moderate | Second largest. The rewrite is a one-line word-final `െ`↔`േ` regex, but real minimal pairs exist (particles vs. loanwords vs. inflections), so it needs a whitelist + guards, not a blanket rule. Sibling of C1 on the e-axis. |
| <a name="c9"></a>C9 | **Colloquial temporal contraction** `-പ്പോൾ`/`-പ്പം` → `-പ്പൊ`, `-മ്പോൾ` → `-മ്പം`/`-മ്പൊ` | `അപ്പോൾ`→`അപ്പൊ`, `ഇപ്പോൾ`→`ഇപ്പൊ`, `ചിലപ്പോൾ`→`ചിലപ്പം` | **944** | ★★★ moderate | Largest single gap, but the target forms scatter (`-പ്പൊ`/`-പ്പം`/`-മ്പം`) so it's a curated map over the *appōḷ/ippōḷ* closed word class canonicalizing to one form, not a single regex. |
| <a name="c12"></a>C12 | **Verb `വ` ↔ `ക` alternation** | `ഉണ്ടാവും`↔`ഉണ്ടാകും`, `പോവാൻ`↔`പോകാൻ`, `ആവും`↔`ആകും` | 98 | ★★★ moderate | Regular *va/ka* stem variation, but `വ`↔`ക` can't be rewritten blindly (distinct verbs collide) — needs a curated per-stem map with morphological guards. |

**Longer tail (lower frequency, same character):** loanword vowel `a↔e` drift
(`പേരന്റ്`/`പേരെന്റ്` — extends C5, ≈34); colloquial pronoun forms (`നമ്മൾക്ക്`/`നമുക്ക്`,
`എല്ലാരും`/`എല്ലാവരും` — borderline lexical, ≈51); dialectal `വെക്ക/വച്ച` *ai↔e*
(`വച്ച്`/`വെച്ച്` — borderline, ≈67); `-ിയിട്ട്`→`-ീട്ട്` contraction; `-ിയിൽ`→`-ീൽ`
contraction (`രീതിയിൽ`/`രീതില്`); `കൈയിൽ`/`കയ്യിൽ` metathesis; `ആഴ്ച്ച`/`ആഴ്ച`;
`പെട്ടന്ന്`/`പെട്ടെന്ന്`; `ശെരി`/`ശരി`; `എന്തേലും`/`എന്തെങ്കിലും`. These are candidates for
the same curated-whitelist treatment only if error analysis shows they matter.

> **Caveat (unchanged policy).** C9–C16 are *spoken-form/dialectal* canonicalizations, not
> encoding fixes. They collapse a real register distinction, so — like C4/C5 — they are
> double-edged for scoring: safe **only** as conservative, symmetric, whitelist-scoped rules
> on closed word classes, and only where the pair is unambiguously the same lexeme. Do **not**
> implement any of them as a general character rewrite. Measure prevalence (the analyzer's gap

## Guardrail test (prevents regressions)

<a name="c7-guard"></a>Add a **self-normalization identity test** per the ACL-2024 METEOR
check: for a basket of real Malayalam sentences, assert `normalize(s)` preserves word count
and non-trivial character overlap with `s`. This is a cheap tripwire against a future
well-meaning change that reintroduces the vanishing-vowels behavior (Mark-class stripping).
Pair it with pinned regression cases for the crown-jewel rules: `വിവേകാനന്ദൻ്റെ` and
`വിവേകാനന്ദന്റെ` → same output (E12); `ട്വൻറ്റി ഫോർ` / `24` / `ഇരുപത്തിനാല്` → same output
(E8/E9).

---

## Recommended order

0. **Guardrail test** (above) — cheap, protects the wins already banked; prevents silently
   reintroducing the vanishing-vowels bug. (C7 fallback-parity is already **resolved** —
   indic-nlp-library is now a hard dependency, so there is a single code path.)
1. **W1 + W3** (postposition split-merge + acronym/letter-sequence collapse) — biggest WER-side wins.
2. **C1 + C2** (samvruthokaram + anusvara) — biggest CER-side wins per line of code, since they
   touch most word endings.
3. **C9 + C10** (colloquial temporal contraction + final `െ`/`േ` drift) — the two largest
   *measured* residual-CER contributors in the real corpora (≈944 + ≈645 occurrences), each a
   closed-class curated rule. See [Corpus-measured spoken-form variants](#corpus-measured-spoken-form-variants-new--from-refhyp-diff-analysis).
4. Remaining items (W2, W4, W5, C3–C6, C8, C11–C16) as they surface in error analysis.

## Appendix: external tool comparison

The reference Malayalam normalizers and what each actually does, evaluated for the
**ASR-scoring** use case (symmetric ref+hyp, meaning-preserving, stable).

| capability | ours | indic-nlp-library | libindic/normalizer | whisper_normalizer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFC (E1) | ✅ | ➖ does own | ➖ | ➖ |
| chillu ZWJ-seq → atomic (E2) | ✅ via indic-nlp | ✅ default | ✅ | ✅ |
| **`ൻ്റ→ന്റ` conjunct (E12)** | ✅ **unique** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| two-part vowel signs (`ൊ ോ ൌ`) | ✅ via indic-nlp (required) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| colon → visarga | ✅ via indic-nlp (required) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Indic danda `।॥` removed (E5) | ✅ | ➖ | ❌ ASCII-only | ➖ |
| Indic digit → ASCII (E6) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **digit verbalization (E8)** | ✅ **unique** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **English↔Malayalam number canon. (E9)** | ✅ **unique** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mark-class stripping (the bug) | ❌ correctly avoids | ❌ correctly avoids | ❌ correctly avoids | ⚠️ in non-Indic base path |
| opinionated typo/spelling "fix" | ❌ correctly avoids | ➖ opt-in | ⚠️ **on by default** | ➖ |

Notes:
- **indic-nlp-library** (Anoop Kunchukuttan, MIT) — the de-facto standard and our required
  backend. Its `MalayalamNormalizer` composes legacy ZWJ chillu → atomic (default on),
  does two-part vowels / poorna-virama / colon→visarga (default on), and `റ്റ→ട്ട` +
  reverse chillu decomposition (default **off**). Does **not** handle E12.
- **libindic/normalizer** (Santhosh Thottingal / SMC, LGPL) — YAML-rule driven; removes
  **only ASCII punctuation** (misses danda/curly quotes) and ships an opinionated typo
  corrector flagged "needs thorough review". Not suitable as-is for scoring.
- **whisper_normalizer** (Kurian Benoy, 5M+ downloads) — wraps indic-nlp's Malayalam
  normalizer for the `ml` path but defaults to the broken `BasicTextNormalizer` for the
  non-Indic path; evidence that indic-nlp is the community base, not a distinct algorithm.
- **AI4Bharat / IndicNLP** — uses indic-nlp-library for normalization; not a separate
  algorithm.
